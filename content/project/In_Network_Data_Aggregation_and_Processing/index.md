### Abstract

In this paper, we cover various aspects of in-network data aggregation and processing in wireless sensor networks. We survey existing literature about energy efficiency, security, compression and query processing methods, looking at multiple existing research papers across these domains, identifying and highlighting key research objectives, methodologies and finally discuss how they build upon or improve previously existing solutions. Finally, we discuss future research goals in each of the areas.
